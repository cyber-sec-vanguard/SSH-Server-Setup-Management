# SSH Server Setup and Management
In this project, I will set up an SSH server, and manage it. I will do my best to document everything -unlike me other projects. Eventually, I will try to automate this setup and management, resulting in another DevSecOps project.

First things first, I will setup an SSH server on my virtual machine.
